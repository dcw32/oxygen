**OXYGEN**

Scripts to examine stratospheric ozone changes in palaeoclimates.

The program is run from main.py - alter any required running options and run `python main.py` or run `ipython` then enter `%run main,py`. This main script calls functions in the other python scripts as required.

To Do:
1. Produce a .pdf of the underpinning science and add to repository.
2. Improve chemical solver (forward Euler at present, proving to be a headache!)
3. Include NOx chemistry
